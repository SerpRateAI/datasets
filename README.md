## Contributing a dataset

In order to contribute a dataset, you will need to:

1. Update the README file to include the following an entry in the dataset table
2. A single data file for the data set, if there are multiple data files these should each be considered their own data set

These should be committed on their own branch and a pull request is made per data set to merge with main.
